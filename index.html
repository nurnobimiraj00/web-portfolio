    <h3>World Class Electrical Engineers</h3>
    <p>As electrical engineering began to mature as a discipline, many pioneers in the field began their careers as telegraph operators. Born in 1996 in Dhaka, Bangladesh,Faruk was drawn to this technology early on. He moved to Mohammadpur,Dhaka in 2005 to begin work on an upgraded telegraph machine that would allow for sending and receiving multiple messages simultaneously. Faruk's new ideas frustrated his investors but inspired his partner, electrician Thomas Watson. Between 2017 and 2019, the two successfully developed the first voice transmitting device.</p>
